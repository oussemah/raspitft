Some custom scripts to setup a Raspebrry Pi to work with wifi and a 2.2 QVGA TFT hosting an ILI9341 or ILI9340 controller

 * Wifi Configuration
 Make sure to update the script configureWifi.bash with your ssid and password, then invoke it with root privileges
 Then reboot your pi and you should get wifi running at boot time
